This is a website that features a website that dynamically puts gifs on the web page after a user clicks a topic button. The button with generate gifs based on the value of the topic button. There is an input field at the bottom where a user can put a search term and click the Add a Topic! button to add the button to the list of buttons. The user can then click that button and generate gifs based on that new search term. There is an intro video when the website loads that is from Final Fantasy XV when Prompto, one of the main character's best friends, takes a photo of Noctis, the main character. The intro video starts after the user clicks on the video. The text that tells the user to click the video disappears and the video plays. After Prompto takes a photo, it shows the photo he took and then moves to the photography menu within the game. The video ends and then disappears from view and is replaced with a png of an image of the same menu. The image is now used as the layout for the webpage. There are instructions as well for the user to read to understand how to use the web page. The layout of the page was done with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The back end has JavaScript, jQuery and Ajax.
